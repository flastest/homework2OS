hi eitan, this is a readme

you can run this by typing make. then do ./benchmark. It'll tell you the times
for different size of the trials. 

If you look at the super awesome gnuplot, you'll see that there's a sharp increase 
corresponding to page misses at 30,000,000. Super cool! I wish I could force my brain
to focus, but my brain doesn't want to focus. It just wants to nap. I'm gonna try
new focus pills sooon so then I'll be able to focus, Eitan!
